This is an (in-progress) pip-installable gym package for a 2-D crafting environment first described in the [Plan Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14033) paper published in Neurips 2019. 

To store each episode as a gif, call ```env.allow_gif_storage()```, which will store each episode under a ```/renders/``` subdirectory

Mechanics of this environment are not mine, this is an adaptation of the [original repo](https://github.com/cdevin/craftingworld).
